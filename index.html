                <article>
                    My name is Jack Warrick and I am a full stack developer working out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I graduated from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with a degree in journalism and immediately began working in newspapers as a reporter. After that journey, I decided it was time for a change and I became a Marketing Assistant with Xcel Energy in a technology-focused organization within the company. From that experience, I realized that I had a passion for technology and coding, and I enrolled in a University of Minnesota coding boot camp where I learned all of the fantastic skills necessary to be a successful full stack developer. Please view the programs I have created below.
